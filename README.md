## Introduction

FitLit is an activity tracker that shows a user's individual activity and wellness data.
Users are able to view their sleep, step and hydration stats, along with that user's data in relation to a database of other user's data. Test driven development was used to drive the implementation of our code, making sure the data presented for each day is accurate.
